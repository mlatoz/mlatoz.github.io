### What K-Means does for you

### How did it do that?

* **STEP 1:** Choose the number *K* of clusters

* **STEP 2:** Select at random *K* points, the centroids (not necessarily from your dataset)

* **STEP 3:** Assign each data point to the closest centroid **→** That forms *K* clusters

* **STEP 4:** Compute and place the new centroid of each cluster

* **STEP 5:** Reassign each data point to the new closest centroid.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If any reassignment took place, go to **STEP 4**, otherwise go to **FIN**.

* **FIN:** Your Model is Ready

## How do Self-Organizing Maps Learn?

* Important to know:
    * SOMs retain topology of the input set
    * SOMs reveal correlations that are not easily identified
    * SOMs classify data without supervision
    * No target vector → no backpropagation
    * No lateral connections between output nodes

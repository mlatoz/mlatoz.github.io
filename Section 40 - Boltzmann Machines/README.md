# Part 5 - Boltzmann Machines

## Welcome to Part 5 - Boltzmann Machines

* In this part you will learn:
    * The Intuition of Boltzmann Machines
    * How to build a Boltzmann Machine

* Boltzmann Machines can be seen from two different points of view:
    * An Energy-Based Model
    * A Probabilistic Graphical Model

In the Intuition Lectures Kirill will focus more on the Energy-Based Model point of view, and then for the Practical Lectures we will focus more on the Probabilistic Graphical Model point of view.

* In these last two parts (**Part 5 - Boltzmann Machines** and **Part 6 - AutoEncoders**) of this course, we will create two types of Recommender Systems:
    * One that predicts binary ratings "Like" or "Not Like". We will build it in this *Part 5* with a *Boltzmann Machine*.
    * Another one that predicts ratings from 1 to 5. We will build it in *Part 6* with an *AutoEncoder*.

* We will implement these two Deep Learning models with PyTorch, a highly advanced Deep Learning platform more powerful than Keras. Every single line of code will be explained in details but I would recommend to have a first look at the PyTorch documentation to start getting familiar with PyTorch:
    * [PyTorch Documentation Here](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/)

*Enjoy Deep Learning!*

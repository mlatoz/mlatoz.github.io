# Part 6 - AutoEncoders

## Welcome to Part 6 - AutoEncoders

* In this part you will learn:
    * The Intuition of AutoEncoders
    * How to build an AutoEncoder from scratch with PyTorch
    * How to manipulate classes and objects to improve and tune your AutoEncoder

* Boltzmann Machines can be seen from two different points of view:
    * An Energy-Based Model
    * A Probabilistic Graphical Model

In the previous part we created a Recommender System that predicted binary ratings "Like" or "Not Like". In this part we will take it at the next level and create a Recommender System that predicts ratings from 1 to 5.

* We will implement a Stacked AutoEncoders model with PyTorch, a highly advanced Deep Learning platform more powerful than Keras. Every single line of code will be explained in details but I would recommend to have a first look at the PyTorch documentation to start getting familiar with PyTorch:
    * [PyTorch Documentation Here](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/)

*Enjoy Deep Learning!*

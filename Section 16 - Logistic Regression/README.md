# Logistic Regression

`Good`
- Less prone to over-fitting but it can overfit in high dimensional datasets.
- Efficient when the dataset has features that are linearly separable.
- Easy to implement and efficient to train.

`Bad`
- Should not be used when the number of observations are lesser than the number of features.
- Assumption of linearity which is rare in practise.
- Can only be used to predict discrete functions.

## Logistic Regression Intuition
* **Logistic Regression**: Predict a <u>categorical</u> dependent variable from a number of independent variables.

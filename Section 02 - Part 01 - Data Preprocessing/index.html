    <hr>

    <p>Welcome to Part 01 on Data Preprocessing!</p>
    <hr>

    <p>We will start by learning and doing Data Preprocessing in Python (next section), and then in R (section after Python). I remind that it is not necessary to master the two languages. We just made this course in both Python and R so that everyone can work on its favourite programming language.</p>

    <p>So feel free to pick the section you want (Python or R), and then move on to <a href="https://github.com/gandharvk422/Machine_Learning_A-Z/blob/main/Section%2005%20-%20Part%2002%20-%20Regression%2FREADME.md">Part 2 - Regression</a>.</p>

    <p>Excited to begin with you the Machine Learning journey!</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Data preprocessing is the process of cleaning and transforming raw data to make it suitable for analysis or machine learning tasks.</li>
        <li>In the below notebook, data preprocessing steps include handling missing data using SimpleImputer and scaling numerical features using StandardScaler.</li>

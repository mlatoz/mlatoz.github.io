# Polynomial Regression

* *Polynomial Regression* is a type of regression analysis that is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is a special case of multiple linear regression, where the independent variables are not linearly related to the dependent variable.

* In Polynomial Regression, the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is modeled as an n<sup>th</sup> degree polynomial equation. The goal of Polynomial Regression is to find the coefficients of the polynomial equation that best fit the data.

* This is commonly used in applications such as finance, where it is used to model the relationship between variables such as stock prices and economic indicators. It is also used in machine learning and data analysis, where it is used to model the relationship between variables in a nonlinear way.

* Overall, Polynomial Regression is a powerful tool for modeling complex relationships between variables and is widely used in various fields.
